# üì¶ AWS Snowball ‚Äì README

## üìò Overview

**AWS Snowball** is a part of the **AWS Snow Family**, offering secure and rugged devices to move **large volumes of data** into and out of AWS. It is ideal for scenarios where **network transfer is too slow or impractical** due to scale or connectivity.

> "Physically ship your data to AWS instead of uploading it over the internet."

## üîÅ Use Cases

| Scenario                             | Solution with Snowball               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Large-scale cloud data migration     | Use Snowball Edge Storage Optimized  |
| Edge computing in remote areas       | Use Snowball Edge Compute Optimized  |
| Disaster recovery backups            | Use Snowball for backup and restore  |
| AI/ML in disconnected regions        | Use Snowball with GPU for processing |
| Data collection from ships, oil rigs | Snowcone/Snowball in rugged cases    |

## üîê Security Features

- **Data encryption (AES-256)** by default
- Managed encryption keys with **AWS KMS**
- **Tamper-resistant** hardware
- Secure Erase: auto-deletion after successful import
- Enforced IAM roles for usage control

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

AWS Console ‚Üí Create Snowball job

AWS ships encrypted device to your site

You connect via Snowball client or AWS OpsHub

Transfer data to/from the device

Ship device back to AWS

AWS imports data into your S3 bucket

## üñ•Ô∏è You can also run:

- EC2 instances on Snowball Edge
- AWS Lambda functions
- Custom applications at the edge

## üöö Transfer Methods

| Method           | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS OpsHub**   | GUI-based local Snowball management           |
| **Snowball CLI** | Command-line access to device                 |
| **S3 SDK**       | Interact with Snowball as a local S3 endpoint |
| **NFS Adapter**  | Mount Snowball as a network drive             |

---

## üìà Monitoring & Tracking

Track job progress in the AWS Console

Get shipment updates and notifications

Audit logs via AWS CloudTrail

## üìä Cost Components

| Item                   | Pricing Notes                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Job Fee (device usage) | Per job (flat rate based on region/device) |
| Data Transfer          | Typically **free into AWS**, out is billed |
| Extra Days On-site     | Charged after first 10 days                |
| Shipping Fees          | Included in most regions                   |

## üåê Edge Computing Support (Snowball Edge)

- Run EC2 AMIs (up to 52 vCPUs, 208 GB RAM)

- Deploy Lambda functions

- Use NVIDIA GPUs (on Compute Optimized model)

Perform:

Video processing

Machine learning inference

Local analytics (SQL, stream)

## üîç Comparison: Snowball vs Snowcone vs Transfer

| Method           | Best For                              | Data Volume    | Transfer Speed        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| **Snowball**     | Large offline transfers               | 10s‚Äì100s TB    | \~1 GB/sec locally    |
| **Snowcone**     | Small-scale/remote/off-grid transfers | \~8 TB         | USB-C, Wi-Fi/Ethernet |
| **AWS DataSync** | Online sync from NFS/SMB              | 100s of TB     | Over internet/VPN     |
| **AWS Transfer** | SFTP, FTP, FTPS file-based access     | Live file sync | Internet              |
