# ‚ö° AWS DataSync ‚Äì README

## üìò Overview

**AWS DataSync** is a **secure, fast, online data transfer service** that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving large amounts of data between:

- On-premises storage (NFS, SMB)
- AWS storage services like **Amazon S3**, **EFS**, and **FSx**

> Ideal for **migrating**, **backing up**, or **replicating** data with minimal manual intervention.

## üöÄ Key Benefits

- üîÑ Automates **incremental and full data transfers**
- ‚ö° Up to **10√ó faster** than traditional transfer tools
- üîê Supports **encryption**, **compression**, **data integrity validation**
- üß† **Built-in scheduling and filtering**
- üí∞ Pay only for **data copied** ‚Äì no upfront costs

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Source (On-prem or AWS)

‚Üì

DataSync Agent (on-prem VM or AWS-managed)

‚Üì

Destination (S3, EFS, FSx)

- Install and activate **DataSync agent** (only for NFS/SMB on-prem)
- Define **source** and **destination**
- Configure **task options** (schedule, filters, logging)
- Monitor **task execution** in console
